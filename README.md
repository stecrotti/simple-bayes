Reproducing the results shown in lecture 15 of the amazing "Information Theory, Pattern Recognition, and Neural Networks" series by David MacKay ([youtube link](https://youtu.be/Z1pcTxvCOgw)).

Starting from plain perceptron learning, motivating and building a simple Bayesian inference framework.

Julia language.
